The Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) planetary defense mission flew to the 
(65803) Didymos system and impacted 
Dimorphos, the moon in that system, to attempt to modify the moon's orbit. The LICIACube cubesat
flew along with the DART primary spacecraft until shortly before impact, at which point it 
detached to observe the impact and survive the encounter. The successful impact of the DART
spacecraft occured on 26 September 2022. The DART spacecraft carried the DRACO (Didymos
Reconnaissance and Asteroid Camera for Optical Navigation) instrument on board. The LICIACube
satellite carries two imagers: LICIACube Explorer Imaging for Asteroid (LEIA), a panchromatic 
camera; and LICIACube Unit Key Explorer (LUKE), a wide-field RGB camera.
